// Small shared socket idioms for the two TCP workers (AiControlServer
// HTTP + SuperSerialCard telnet bridge). Two hard-won rules live here so
// they are fixed ONCE:
//
//   1. poll()-before-accept: `shutdown(listenFd, SHUT_RDWR)` wakes a
//      blocking accept() on Linux but NOT on macOS/BSD — a worker parked
//      in accept() there never returns and the owner hangs in join().
//      This deadlock was found and fixed in AiControlServer, then
//      re-discovered months later in SuperSerialCard (whose destructor
//      runs under stateMutex during profile switches — a UI-thread hang).
//      Windows is a third variant of the same problem: closesocket() on a
//      listener does wake a blocked accept(), but the handle is then free
//      to be recycled by the next socket() on another thread, so the
//      wait-then-accept shape is what makes the shutdown sequence safe
//      everywhere rather than on Linux only.
//
//   2. SIGPIPE-proof send: a peer that vanished uncleanly must surface as
//      an error return, not kill the process. Linux spells that
//      MSG_NOSIGNAL; macOS/BSD have no such flag — there the socket needs
//      SO_NOSIGPIPE set once after accept (disableSigpipe). Windows has no
//      SIGPIPE at all, so both are no-ops there.
//
// The POSIX-vs-Winsock differences themselves are NOT here — they live in
// SocketCompat.h, which this header is written against. Not used by the
// Emscripten build (no sockets there); both includers guard their network
// paths with #if POM2_HAS_SOCKETS.
