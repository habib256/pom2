// W5100NameResolver — the virtual-DNS half of the Uthernet II.
//
// The real W5100 has no name resolution; POM2 adds it so a guest can write a
// hostname into the socket's DNS registers and get an address back
// (`Uthernet2.cpp:1012-1037`). That is a HOST lookup, and host lookups block:
// the whole design here exists to keep a slow or dead resolver from stalling
// the CPU thread, which calls this under stateMutex.
//
// Three rules, and each one is load-bearing:
//   * the lookup runs off-thread with a BOUNDED wait. A timed-out lookup is
//     not cancelled — it parks its answer in a mailbox that poll() drains on
//     the CPU thread, so the cache stays single-threaded.
//   * in-flight lookups are CAPPED. A guest looping OPEN over random
//     hostnames would otherwise pile up resolver threads without bound.
//   * the mailbox is shared by shared_ptr, so a lookup that outlives the card
//     (the user pulled it out of the slot mid-resolve) has nowhere unsafe to
//     write.
//
// The lookup itself is injectable so a test can resolve deterministically,
// with no network and no waiting.
