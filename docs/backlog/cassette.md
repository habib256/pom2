# Backlog — Cassette

[Planning index](../../TODO.md) · [Scope decisions](../decisions/project-scope.md)

Reorganised 2026-10-05. Priorities are inherited from the original TODO;
older reports are **To verify**, not confirmed defects on current main.
Before implementation, reproduce the described behavior on current main and
record the result. If already resolved, remove the active entry and link its
resolution in the changelog. Frozen work requires a named software need or
an explicit request before scheduling.
