# Backlog — WebAssembly

[Planning index](../../TODO.md) · [Scope decisions](../decisions/project-scope.md)

Reorganised 2026-10-05. Priorities are inherited from the original TODO;
older reports are **To verify**, not confirmed defects on current main.
Before implementation, reproduce the described behavior on current main and
record the result. If already resolved, remove the active entry and link its
resolution in the changelog. Frozen work requires a named software need or
an explicit request before scheduling.

## WASM-001 — Direct disk-image upload / drop-zone

**Priority:** 🧊 · **State:** Frozen.

**Scheduling condition:** a named software requirement or an explicit request; define acceptance tests before implementation.

**Evidence:** [original report](../archive/todo-2026-10-05.md#source-2121). Original dates and estimates are retained below.

Direct disk-image upload/drop-zone mounting remains frozen. The browser is
not restricted to build-time content: `BrowserFiles` and
`wasm/browser_files.js` already provide text upload and `.pom2session`
import/export. Sessions can embed disk contents; automatic resume stores
supported configurations in IndexedDB. These do not provide a generic
disk-image picker wired to drive insertion. See the
[session contract](../session-format.md) and [RELEASE-005](release-1.0.md#release-005)
for the implemented browser persistence checks.

## WASM-002 — Mobile touch input

**Priority:** 🧊 · **State:** Frozen.

**Scheduling condition:** a named software requirement or an explicit request; define acceptance tests before implementation.

**Evidence:** [original report](../archive/todo-2026-10-05.md#source-2124). Original dates and estimates are retained below.

- 🧊 **Mobile touch input** — GLFW3 under Emscripten does not map
  touch → mouse off-canvas. JS wrapper `touchstart/move/end` →
  `Module._inject_mouse_*`.

## WASM-003 — Audio worklet tuning

**Priority:** 🧊 · **State:** Frozen.

**Scheduling condition:** a named software requirement or an explicit request; define acceptance tests before implementation.

**Evidence:** [original report](../archive/todo-2026-10-05.md#source-2127). Original dates and estimates are retained below.

- 🧊 **Audio worklet tuning** — miniaudio Web Audio works but
  latency ~150 ms is audible on speaker click. Explore a custom
  `AudioWorkletNode` or shrink the buffer.
